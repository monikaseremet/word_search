# word_search
Program that return a list containing all the words included in the file (words.txt) match the specific search term.

The search term may include lowercase letters and the following wildcard characters:

 - A dot **.** means that any single character is acceptable in its place. For example, **ca.** would yield words like *cat* and *car*, **p.ng** would yield words like *ping* and *pong*, and **.a.e** would yield words like *sane, care* and *late*.
- An asterisk * at the *end* of the search term means that any word which *begins* with the search term is acceptable. An asterisk at the *beginning* of the search term means that any word which *ends* with the search term is acceptable. For example, **ca***  would yield words like *california, cat, caring* and *catapult*, while * ane would yield words like *crane, insane* and *aeroplane*. There can only ever be a single asterisk in the search term.
- If there are no wildcard characters in the search term, only words which match the search term exactly are returned.
